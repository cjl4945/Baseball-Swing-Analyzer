# Baseball Swing Analyzer

## Abstract
Technology is rapidly being integrated into sports to help athletes optimize their movements. This project was developed during a **hackathon** to design and prototype a system for analyzing the biomechanical efficiency of a batterâ€™s swing in real time. By utilizing **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)** and **microcontrollers**, the system captures and outputs swing metrics via an **web browser interface**, providing intuitive feedback for users.

The system consists of **two IMUs** connected to a **Raspberry Pi via TCP sockets**. The Raspberry Pi operates as an **ad-hoc network**, allowing users to connect to its IP address and access the swing measurement interface through a **web browser**.

Our system demonstrates an error range of **1 - 3 degrees**, outperforming commercial alternatives like the **WitMotion IMU**. Compared to the high-end **4D Motion Baseball** device, our implementation shows a **9% and 3% difference in maximum rotational velocity** and a **13.6% and 26.6% difference in total rotation for shoulders and hips, respectively**. The goal is to provide an affordable yet effective tool for schools, coaches, parents, and players to improve their game.

## Background
Baseball, like all sports, is evolving with advancements in technology. Various high-end swing analyzers such as **Rapsodo, 4D Motion, and HitTrax** track and measure player performance, but their high cost makes them inaccessible to many teams and athletes. 

This project aims to create a **financially feasible alternative** that maintains accuracy while being accessible to schools and players who otherwise lack access to expensive tools. By providing a level playing field, our solution empowers athletes with data-driven insights to improve their performance.
